# Computer learns to play Flappy bird

For the course of AI me and Domen Grzin chose the project **Computer learns to play Flappy bird**.

We used the UI of my personal project from a few years back. We had to fix it first then we added an agent that plays the game. The agent uses Q-learning to learn how to play the game.
